- [Terraform will fail if the state file is too big](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21709). This is especially problematic if we use `file()` directive frequently.
- AWS IAM roles can be assumed from EKS cluster without passing access/secret keys.
- Terraform has [for-comprehensions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/expressions/for.html)
- Terraform's `external` data needs to return json.
