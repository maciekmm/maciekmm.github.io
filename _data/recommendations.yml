  recommendation: I was responsible for managing Maciej's work during his internship at Dynatrace, and I really didn't have much to worry about, apart from running out of tasks planned for him. Maciej is a very talented developer, with great ideas and ability to make them happen. His work was of exceptional quality and technical skills far above expectations you might have for an intern. I'm looking forward to being able to work with Maciej again in the future.
